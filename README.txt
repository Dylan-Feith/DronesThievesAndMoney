# DronesThievesAndMoney
Java Project 2014
In this project, Drones must catch Thieves whose goals are to steal two bags of Money. The more money Thieves have, the slower they are. It has been developped under Eclipse. You can change the simulation map by modifying the file world.txt

You can directly import the zip file with Eclipse.
